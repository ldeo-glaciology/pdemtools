# Batch processing

Using the `pdemtools` suite of functions, it is possible to efficiently download and preprocess batches of ArcticDEM and REMA imagery.

An example of a batch download/coregistration scripts for ArcticDEM and REMA strips are [made available at the `pdemtools` GitHub](https://github.com/trchudley/pdemtools/tree/main/batch). Two different batch scripts are made available: one to coregister against the ArcticDEM mosiac, and one to coregister against contemporaneous ICESat-2 data.
